### :woman_technologist: About Me :
I'm Anna, an NLP Engineer with a passion for sign languages :love_you_gesture:. You'll find my GitHub primarily filled with materials for papers and university projects, such as:
 - :laughing: [multimodal_humour](https://github.com/kuzanna2016/multimodal_humour) - materials for my Master's thesis and upcoming paper on the development of a new multimodal multilingual dataset for laughter detection in Russian and English stand-up comedy videos, exploring various laughter annotation techniques and humour detection multimodal models
- :raised_eyebrow: [non-manuals-2021](https://github.com/kuzanna2016/non-manuals-2021) - materials for my Bachelor's thesis and following paper ["Functional Data Analysis of Non-manual Marking of Questions in Kazakh-Russian Sign Language"](https://aclanthology.org/2022.signlang-1.19/). It is a study comparing non-manual markers of polar and wh-questions to statements in Kazakh-Russian Sign Language (KRSL), utilizing computer vision face recognition solutions, such as _OpenPose_ and _OpenFace_.
